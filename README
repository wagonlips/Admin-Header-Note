Places a small note with an optional link at the top of the admin pages.

== Description ==

This plugin simply places a small, bordered note with an optional link at the top of the admin pages 
inside the WordPress dashboard. Nothing fancy, just a simple way to draw the attention of everyone 
who might be visiting the admin pages to something important, where the README files for the site are, 
for instance.

Obviously, this plugin will primarily be useful to sites with multiple administrators.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `Admin-Header-Note` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the Admin Header Note options page to configure message, location, color, and link.

*   The Admin Header Note can be positioned and colored using any CSS unit (http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_units.asp),
    including %, in, cm, mm, em, ex, pt, pc, and px, for positioning, and color name, comma separated RGB values, comma 
    separated RGB percentages, or HEX number for color. Check above link for examples. 
    Coordinate origin is the upper right corner.

*   In the link field, it is incumbent upon the user to supply a valid URI, absolute or relative. 
    A relative link must use the WordPress site root.

*   The message field will accept text of any length, but anything over a few words will be difficult to position neatly.
